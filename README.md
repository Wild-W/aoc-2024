# Advent of Code 2024

## How to run:

Create a `.txt` file named the number of the day, and paste the input into that file. Then compile and run the code for that day.

For example:

* Filename: `3.txt`
* Content: `xmul(2,4)&mul[3,7]!^don't()_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64](mul(11,8)undo()?mul(8,5))`
* Cmd: `deno run --allow-read=. 3p2.js`

I've listed the runtimes and compilers that I used when developing each solution, but in most cases any should work as I avoid platform specific features.

## Day 1

* Language: Lua
* Runtime: Lua 5.4

## Day 2

* Language: C++
* Compiler: GCC

## Day 3

* Language: Javascript
* Runtime: Deno

## Day 4

* Language: Python
* Runtime: CPython
